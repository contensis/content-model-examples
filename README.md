# Example content models for Contensis

> Example content models made with Contensis

[Contensis](https://www.zengenti.com/en-gb/products/contensis) lets you build a site around your content, so it works exactly how you need it to. It separates the way your content is created and stored from the way it is presented. So, you can create content in advance so your project stays on track, or break it up into pieces that you can reuse in other websites and apps.
